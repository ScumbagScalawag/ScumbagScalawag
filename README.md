### Hello friend ðŸ‘‹
My name is Noah. I make stuff. Here's some of my details. 

#### ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
  - Here's my **Email**: noahmcivor@gmail.com
  - I use **Discord** frequently: ScumbagScalawag#8575

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - How to work in teams using **Git** and **GitHub**
  - **Data Structures and Algorithms**
  - **Debugging** code (with [nvim DAP](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap))

#### ðŸ’» When I'm not working on school work, I'm off being a nerd with these things:
  - Linux ([Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) Linux, that is)
  - neovim (technically [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/))
  - Terminal Customization (I use [Kitty Terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#) at the moment)
  - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the markdown editor

#### ðŸŒ³ I go outside. Sometimes. When I do, these are things I like:
  - Nature
  - Longboarding (Longboard Dancing)
  - Mountain Biking (but, like, not the hard-core version)

##### Why is your username like that?
  - Well, when I was in highschool, I created my Discord and GitHub profiles to facilitate some light gaming. I was certain I hated technology and treated my Discord and GitHub profiles like as if nobody would ever see them. Now, **technology is the core of what I do**. I may change my profile name one day, but for now it stays.
