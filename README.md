# Hello friend 👋
My name is Noah. I make stuff. Here's some of my details. 

## ⌨️ Some tech I use: 
- TypeScript (+ [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) & [Deno](https://deno.com))
- C#
- Go (+ [htmx](https://htmx.org/))
- Bash (but usually Go instead, these days)

Some from my university days:
- C++
- C
- Python

## 💻 I'm usually off being a nerd with these things:
- Linux ([Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org/), probably forever)
- neovim (technically [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/))
- Terminal Customization (I use [Kitty Terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#) at the moment)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the markdown editor

## 🌳 I go outside. Sometimes. When I do, these are things I like:
- Nature
- Longboarding (Longboard Dancing)
- Mountain Biking (but, like, not the hard-core version)

## 📫 How to reach me: 
- Here's my **Email**: noahmcivor@gmail.com
- I use **Discord** frequently for collaboration: ScumbagScalawag#8575

##### Why is your username like that?
- Well, when I was in highschool, I created my Discord and GitHub profiles to facilitate some light gaming stuff. I treated my Discord and GitHub profiles like as if nobody would ever see them. Now, **technology is the core of what I do**. There is a lot of overlap in the tech I use in my leisure and the tech I use for work. I may change my profile name one day, but for now it stays.
